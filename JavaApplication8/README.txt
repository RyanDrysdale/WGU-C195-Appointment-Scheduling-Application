Javaapplication8 

This is a scheduling application used for creating and managing appointment information


The application will promt the User to login upon opening.  With a successfull login the user will be notified if there is an appointment
scheduled within 15 minutes of login.  You will be given 3 options on the mainscreen.  The Customers button will be for adding, updating and deleting
customers. The appointment tab will be for adding, updating and deleting appointments.  The reports tab will show you all current appointments and contacts.
Appointments will not be allowed to be scheduled outside of business hours or during existing appointment times.  Language will change based of users zoneID.

The third tab in my Report has a bar graph that shows the number of currently created appointments for each appointment type.
